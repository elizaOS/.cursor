Please note that we always use bun for our package manager and file running, NOT npm or pnpm

For testing, we run 'elizaos test' on plugins and projects, and vitest on core packages

Our e2e plugin and project tests are run by elizaos and should not include vitest global state or objects

Our unit tests are in vitest

We typically store tests in `src/__tests__/`
